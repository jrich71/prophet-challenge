# Prophet Challenge

This assignment tasked me with analyzing financial and user search data to discover past trends and predict future trends. The work breakdown falls into 4 areas:

* Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic.

* Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality.

* Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns.

* Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet.
